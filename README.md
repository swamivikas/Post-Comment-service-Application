# requirements 

  1 . you have to create virtual environment and install django in that 

       to create virtual environment    : python -m venv (your virtual enivronment name )
       to install django make you are in the same directory :  pip install django

 2  .  installation of pillow and beautifulsoup and django-allauth 

     for beautifulsoup : pip install beautifulsoup
     for pillow :        pip install pillow 
     for django-allauth : pip install django-allauth

# why i choose Django over other 
  Django has built-in features that make it safer to use the user-submitted data on the application
  and django is having inbuilt sqlite database however we cannot use its inbuilt database for large projects 

  and django also provides us these features 
   1. Battries included
   2. flexible and scalable
   3. easy to use
   4. active community (it addapts python community )


# lets see how it works
